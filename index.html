            <h2>Online Reputation Management</h2>
            <p>
                The web is full of opinions, and some of these can be negative. Social media allows 
                anyone with an internet connection to say whatever they want about your business. 
                Online Reputation Management gives you the control over what potential customers 
                see when they search for your business.

            <h2>Social Media Marketing</h2>
            <p>
                Social media continues to have a sizable influence on buying 
                habits. Social media marketing helps you determine 
                which platforms are suited to your brand, using analytics 
                to find the right markets and increase your lead generation.
